My idea was to use posts, users and comments for some sort of socail media app to apply usage of data. 
I wasn't able to setup the correct connetion with MongoDB, so I'm sorry about that.
I ended up having some issues also with my files linking them up to this repo, for my last commit. I didn't have it fully finished but did have some changes such as a sample data file.
Anyways, thank you for taking a look at this project, I appreciate it!
